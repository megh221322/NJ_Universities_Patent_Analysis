This analysis will process the US patent data within the 2015 to 2022 timeframe. The aim is to find the percentage of women inventors who are applicants and also estimate the faculty percentage from the data sourced at 
https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/patent-examination-research-dataset-public-pair
The analysis covers eight institutions: NJIT, Stevens, Rutgers, Princeton, NJCU, Seton Hall, Rowan, and Saint Peters University.
WIPO's gender_it library is included in the pipeline to identify the applicant's gender.
The initial analysis also used the assignees but was ignored later for creating duplicates and anomalies.|
The results are validated against publicly available databases like the USPTO public patent search.
